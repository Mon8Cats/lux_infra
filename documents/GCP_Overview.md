# GCP Overview

## AI and ML Fundamentals

- AI is the use of technologies to build machines and computers that are able to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence. It is a set of technologies implemented in a system to reason, learn, and act to solve a complex problem.
- ML is a subset of AL that lets a machine learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- Generative AI is a type of AI that can produce new content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data.
- Data analytics and business intelligence is based on historical data used to calculate metrics and identify trends.
- To create values in my business, I need to use the data to make decisions for future business. AI and ML are the key to unlocking these capabilities.
- ML lets computer systems continuously adjust and enhance themselves as they accrue more experiences.
- ML:
  - replacing or simplifying rule based systems.
  - automate processes.
  - understanding unstructured data.
  - personalization.
- ML requires high-quality data.
  - quality data: completeness, uniqueness, timeliness, validity, accuracy, consistency.
  - completeness: whether all the required information is present.
  - uniqueness: with a high number of duplicates, the ML model may not be able to learn accurately.
  - timeliness: the data is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the phenomenon.
  - validity: the data conforms to a set of predefined standards and definitions (type, format, range).
  - accuracy: the correctness of the data (form, content).
  - consistency: the data is uniform and doesn't contain any contradictory information.
